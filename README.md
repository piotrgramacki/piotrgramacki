I completed my master's degree in Data Science and bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the [Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/). 

I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Brand24](https://brand24.com) and develop [srai](https://github.com/srai-lab/srai) library.
